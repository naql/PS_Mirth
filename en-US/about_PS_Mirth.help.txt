    PowerShell wrapper fro the Mirth RESTful API.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    This module provides PowerShell functions to connect to and perform various functions exposed
    through the Mirth RESTful API. 

    First you must connect to the Mirth server using the Connect-Mirth cmdlet.
    If no other parameters are provided, by default it will connect to https://localhost:8080 as admin/admin.
    Once a mirth connection object has been obtained, the current connection is kept in the session and is 
    automatically supplied on the pipeline to subsequent PS_Mirth commands.
